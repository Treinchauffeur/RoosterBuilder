RoosterBuilder, also known as RoosterBot, collects no personal data for remote processing or collection purposes.
RoosterBot uses user-provided details like pupil and mentor names/phone numbers/email addresses to create a schedule that is visually easy to read.
All data remains on-device unless the user explicitly chooses to forward the processed schedule elsewhere.
